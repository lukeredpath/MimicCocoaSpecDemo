# Testing Objective-C networking code using Mimic

This sample project contains an example of testing HTTP connectivity using [the Mimic gem](https://github.com/lukeredpath/mimic) and it's REST API to configure the stubs.

It uses the [Resty](http://projects.lukeredpath.co.uk/resty) framework for simple, block-based networking and [Kiwi](http://www.kiwi-lib.info/docs.html) and Hamcrest to improve test readability.

## Running the example test

After cloning the project, you'll need to initialize the git submodules to get Kiwi and Hamcrest. You'll also need the bundler gem. Install the Mimic gem from the latest HEAD by running `bundle`.

You should now be able to load Xcode, select the Specs target and build successfully.

Try changing the stubbed response body and see the test fail.
